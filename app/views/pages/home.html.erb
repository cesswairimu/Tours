            Pull requests are the way to go here. I apologise in advance for the
            slow action on pull requests and issues. I only have two rules for submitting
            a pull request: match the naming convention (camelCase, categorised [fades, bounces, etc]) 
            and let us see a demo of submitted animations in a pen. That last one is important.
